# IDG's pipeline for Structural Birth Defects (SBD) data curation:

- Curated Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) Gene-list for SBD and mapped to known small molecules/drugs via DrugCentral
- Curated Known teratogens and xenobiotics that cause SBD to HPO gene
- Used manually curated GreatVessel HPO gene-list and mapped to known small molecules/drugs via DrugCentral
- Used manually curated CNS HPO gene-list and mapped to known small molecules/drugs via DrugCentral
- Used manually curated Heart HPO gene-list and mapped to known small molecules/drugs via DrugCentral
- Human Gene Expression During Development (DESCARTES) alignments with HPO genes
- DESCARTES mapped with LINCS L1000 Up/Down Consensus Gene (drug effect on cell line)
