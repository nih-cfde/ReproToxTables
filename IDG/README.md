# IDG's pipeline for Structural Birth Defects (SBD) data curation:
### SBD terms mapped to HPO to genes
### Using Pharos to query HPM gene expression
- Curated Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) Gene-list for SBD and mapped to known small molecules/drugs via DrugCentral
- Curated Known teratogens and xenobiotics that cause SBD to HPO gene
- Used manually curated **GreatVessel** HPO gene-list and mapped to known small molecules/drugs via DrugCentral
- Used manually curated **CNS** HPO gene-list and mapped to known small molecules/drugs via DrugCentral
- Used manually curated **Heart** HPO gene-list and mapped to known small molecules/drugs via DrugCentral
- Human Gene Expression During Development (DESCARTES) alignments with HPO genes
- DESCARTES mapped with LINCS L1000 Up/Down Consensus Gene (drug effect on cell line)
- Queried Fetal tissue gene expression data from Human Proteome Map (HPM)
