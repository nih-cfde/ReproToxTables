# IDG's pipeline for Structural Birth Defects (SBD) data curation:
### SBD terms mapped to HPO to genes
 - Curated Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) Gene-list for SBD 
 - DrugCentral query to make SBD genes mapped to known small molecules/drugs
 
### Using Pharos to query HPM gene expression
 - Queried Fetal tissue (normal) gene expression data from Human Proteome Map (HPM)
##
 
*description of datasets*
### teratogens
- Curated Known teratogens and xenobiotics that cause SBD to HPO gene
### Great Vessel
- Used manually curated **GreatVessel** HPO gene-list and mapped to known small molecules/drugs via DrugCentral
- Human Gene Expression During Development (DESCARTES) alignments with HPO genes
- DESCARTES mapped with LINCS L1000 Up/Down Consensus Gene (drug effect on cell line)
### CNS
- Used manually curated **CNS** HPO gene-list and mapped to known small molecules/drugs via DrugCentral
- Human Gene Expression During Development (DESCARTES) alignments with HPO genes
- DESCARTES mapped with LINCS L1000 Up/Down Consensus Gene (drug effect on cell line)
### Heart
- Used manually curated **Heart** HPO gene-list and mapped to known small molecules/drugs via DrugCentral
- Human Gene Expression During Development (DESCARTES) alignments with HPO genes
- DESCARTES mapped with LINCS L1000 Up/Down Consensus Gene (drug effect on cell line)
